== Periwinkle Blue

This chess app was built as an agile team exercise through [the Firehose Project](http://thefirehoseproject.com) under the superb direction of [Ilya Krasnov](https://github.com/ilyakrasnov).  The name for our app was inspired by the legendary [Deep Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_%28chess_computer%29) - but since we weren't able to go nearly that deep in a few weeks, we only made it to periwinkle.
