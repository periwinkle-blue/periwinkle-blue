			<h3>Using the Application</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			To begin, create an account by visiting the <%= link_to "sign up", new_user_registration_path, :class => "text-link" %> page.  Once signed in, you can <%= link_to 'create', {:action => "create", :controller => "games"}, :method => :post, :class => "text-link" %> or <%= link_to 'join', games_path, :class => "text-link" %> a game.  After joining a game, when it's your turn, you click on the piece that you want to move and drag it to the space on the board that you wish to move it to.  Upon dropping it there, your move will be validated and if it is in line with the rules of the game, it will then be your opponent's turn to move.  If you have any questions, please <%= link_to "contact us", contact_path, :class => "text-link" %>.
